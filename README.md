## shallowML_classification
Assessing the performance of a Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) classifier and a Random Forest (RF) classifier for automated detection of invasive Sargassum seaweed using Sentinel-2 MSI data.

---

## Classification Task

The first two notebooks train, save, and evaluate shallow classification models:
- **ML1:** Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
- **ML2:** Random Forest (RF)

The final notebook (**ML3**) uses the trained models to make a side-by-side comparison (NB vs RF).

The classifiers are trained to distinguish between **Water** (n = 220) and **Sargassum** (n = 331) on a per-pixel basis.

Each model is trained on labelled data and tested on unseen Sentinel-2 scenes. These are subsetted to reduce runtime.

## Data & Preprocessing Steps

1. **Study Area**: Waters offshore of Barbados.  
2. **Data Source**: Sentinel-2 MSI (Level-1C).  
3. **Atmospheric Correction**: ACOLITE.
4. **Training Labels**: Pixels manually labelled in SNAP.
